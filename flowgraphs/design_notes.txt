Flowgraph external control

*  Rx Doppler frequency offset
   *  Pick up frequency offset from HamLib rigctld
   *  HamLib rigctld gets offset from GPredict or any similar SGP4 orbit prediction code
   *  Flowgraph picks up variable using XMLRPC server and places into variable doppler_offset
   *  Flowgraph already tested to use this variable correctly

*  Tx Transmit control
   *  Simple Tx On/Off switch
   *  Key up transmitter when outgoing "traffic" becomes available in the UPD socket according
      to the following flow.
     *  Key up transmitter
     *  Wait TxDelay (In a variable, ~30 ms) time
     *  Send traffic
     *  Wait TxTail (In a variable, ~10 ms) time
     *  Key down transmitter

Some links on controlling the transmitter


* This guy (VE7GSJ) apparently has solved the problem using the HackRF and the gr osmocom, however he seems
to talk about himself and other things more than what he did in the driver. He says his driver code is posted
online.

*  Discussion on MyriadRF
See <szyg> and <pauluzs> comments.
My experience, when you multiply the TX gain by 0, the carrier is still present.

* Julian Brown at Small Sat 2016 (I was there to see this presentation)
At 5:00 he talks about his Doppler correction
